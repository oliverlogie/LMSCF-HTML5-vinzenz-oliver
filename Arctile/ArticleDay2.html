	<div class="article">
		<p>WASHINGTON — When Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. walks out of his chambers at the Supreme Court, crosses First Street and enters the Capitol to preside over President Trump’s impeachment trial, he will leave behind an institution that prides itself on reason and decorum and enter one marked by partisan warfare.
		<br><br>
		The chief justice’s responsibilities at the trial are fluid and ill-defined, and they will probably turn out to be largely ceremonial. What is certain is that they will be full of peril for his reputation and that of his court.
		<br><br>
		“It’s not a heavy lift, but it’s going to put him in a very, very unpleasant role,” said Philip Bobbitt, a law professor at Columbia and an author, with Charles L. Black Jr., of “Impeachment: A Handbook.” “I’m sure he’ll get ulcers.”
		<br>
		That role could begin as early as Thursday when, after a monthlong delay, the House will vote to appoint a team of lawmakers, known as managers, to prosecute the case against Mr. Trump and, in a highly choreographed exchange, transmit the articles to the Senate.
		<br><br>
		The managers will march the articles over to the Senate chamber, touching off a series of steps that will initiate the trial. But before it can get underway Chief Justice Roberts will be sworn in as the presiding officer and, in his first official act, administer an oath to senators in which they swear to do “impartial justice” in the trial, with the real work not expected to begin until Tuesday.
		<br><br>
		“Any presidential impeachment trial thrusts the chief justice into unfamiliar and unwelcome terrain, said Frank O. Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and the author of “High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump.”
